			<h2>Madison Middle School</h2>
			<p>When Maggie and I first met, we had no idea how <b>crazy</b> and <b>amazing</b> our first year of teaching would be. 
				<br><br>
				We met at Madison Middle School, where she taught 6th grade ELA, and I was the Computer's Class teacher.
				<br><br> 
				Madison was extremely tough! 
				<br><br>
				But we really found comfort in our friendship, which quickly turned into a blossoming courtship. There was something <em>special</em> about this midwestern gal.

			<h2>Golden Birthday</h2>
			<p>Maggie and I planned our Spring Break to go to DC and visit her sisters. What I didn't know was that she had planned a <em>"Golden Birthday"</em> party for me! 
				<br><br>
				It was an <em>amazing</em> birthday week!
				<br><br> 
				We had a blast at Topgolf, played beer pong, and she reserved a dinner date at a speakeasy in DC. 
				<br><br>
				I have never had someone throw me such an amazing birthday. This was the week I <em>knew</em> I wanted to marry Maggie Thomas!

			<h2>"There's no place like <em>HOME!</em></h2>
			<p>After what appeared to be the longest school year ever, we paid out dues and were <b>DONE</b> with Madison Middle!
				<br><br>
				We decided to pack our bags, and move to Kansas City! 
				<br><br> 
				With a quick tap of her heels, Maggie and I were transported to KC, where she taught History at her high school, and I accepted a job teaching elementary Art & Spanish.
				<br><br>
				Out of all my decision I've made in my life, following Maggie to KC has been the <em>best</em> of them ALL!

			<h2>WWI Memorial</h2>
			<p>After spending an <em>amazing</em> school year in KC, I couldn't waste anymore time; I <em>NEEDED</em> to propose to Maggie!  
				<br><br>
				I coordinated with here family, and we spent the day doing her favorite activities:
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>We went to church.</li>
					<li>Ate lunch at Q39.</li>
					<li>Went to the Nelson Atkins Museum with her family.</li>
					<li>Visited Old Red Bridge Love Locks to place out lock. </li>
					<li>Then we went to the WWI Memorial, where I hired a photographer to snap this photo!</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				I threw her off with the Old Red Bridge Love Locks stop, and I am <em>sooo</em> fortunate that Maggie said <b><em>YES!</em></b>

			<h2>The Hobbs Buiding</h2>
			<p><em>THIS WAS IT! OUR WEDDING DAY!</em> 
				<br><br>
				And what a wedding day it was!
				<br><br> 
				Our ceremony was just perfect, and our reception was even <em>better!</em> Our wedding date was February 22, 2020, a few weeks before covid. We had no idea how special this night would really turnout to be.
				<br><br>
				We practiced our first-dance routine for weeks, and all I can say about it was that all that practicing <em>paid off!</em>. The rest of the night was simply amazing, and I will never forget how to fortunate I am to have met my little KC-gal back in Nashville!
